# WeatherClear
 Weather app created using JS, HTML, CSS.
 
 This was a lot of fun and challenging to complete. This is my first completed app with JavaScript and using an API(OpenWeather).
 Given that it was a period of time since I last coded (life) I wanted to return with a new, reinvigorated sense of passion
 and eagerness to learn. 
 
 I chose JavaScript in spite of completing Coding Dojo's bootcamp for Python as I was to flesh out my skillset. This allowed me to 
 be a student again and put in time coding and testing to make sure things work properly before I deploy my site. Shown below is an example of what
 the app looks like.
