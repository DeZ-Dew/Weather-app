# WeatherClear
 WeatherClear app created using JS, HTML, CSS.
 
 This was a lot of fun and challenging to complete. This is my first completed app with JavaScript and using an API(OpenWeather). Given that it was a period of time since I last coded (life) I wanted to return with a new, reinvigorated sense of passion and eagerness to learn. 

 The purpose of this app is to provide accurate weather information to the user. What the user will see is a search box that will load the current temperature of the from the city of their choosing. This data was pull by a function named "fetchWeather", grabbing the temperature from the open weather service with its apikey unique to the developer. Based on the api provided, the user can view the city, weather temperature(fahrenheit), description of weather condition, humidity, and wind speed within a card the is semi-transparent. Also, each time the user enters the city and click the search icon, the background image will change as well.

 The challenging aspect was utilizing the api properly and typing the function out for it to work. There was a lot to learn with const and "querySelector", which was used in the "displayWeather" function. What I would like to figure out and add to the app is the ability to change the temperature from fahrenheit to celsius with a button. Also, adding where you can search for the state along with  the zip code to get the exact location of what the user would want to enter. 
 
 I chose JavaScript instead of completing Coding Dojo's bootcamp for Python as I wanted to flesh out my skillset. This allowed me to be a student again and put in time coding and testing to make sure things work properly before I deploy my site. Shown below is an example of what the app looks like:
